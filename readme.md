# WebSocket Connection Initialization Using Tokens

To establish a WebSocket connection, you must authenticate using tokens that are provided by a REST API after the user logs in or signs up. These tokens are used for secure communication over WebSockets.

### Authentication Process

1. **Obtain Tokens via REST API**:
   - **Login**: The user logs in by providing their credentials (e.g., username and password) via the REST API. After successful authentication, the API responds with an `access token` (for immediate authentication) and a `refresh token` (to refresh the session when the `access token` expires).
   - **Signup**: The user signs up by providing their registration details. After successful signup, the REST API issues an `access token` and a `refresh token` to authenticate the user.

   **Example of REST API Responses**:

   - **Login**:
     ```json
     {
         "access_token": "your_access_token",
         "refresh_token": "your_refresh_token"
     }
     ```

   - **Signup**:
     ```json
     {
         "access_token": "your_access_token",
         "refresh_token": "your_refresh_token"
     }
     ```

2. **Headers for WebSocket Connection**:
   After obtaining the tokens (via login or signup), include them in the WebSocket connection request headers to authenticate the connection.

### Required Headers for WebSocket Connection

When connecting to the WebSocket server, include the following headers:

- **Authorization**: A Bearer token for access authentication, obtained from the REST API.
- **refresh**: The refresh token, also obtained from the REST API, used to refresh the access token when it expires.

### Example of Headers

```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
refresh: your_refresh_token
```



### Explanation

- **Authorization Header**: The `Authorization` header contains the `access_token` obtained from the REST API. It is used to authenticate the WebSocket connection.
  
- **Refresh Header**: The `refresh` header contains the `refresh_token`, which is used to obtain a new `access_token` if the original one expires.

Hereâ€™s the updated Markdown with information about initializing the WebSocket connection and including the necessary headers (`Authorization` and `refresh` keys):

## WebSocket Message Format for Friendship Messages



### Message Structure

- **type**: Always set to `"friendship"`.
- **channel**: Unique friendship ID (UUID).
- **payload**: The content of the message.
- **media**: (Optional) Array of media files in base64 format.

### Example Message

```json
{
    "type": "friendship",
    "channel": "72c6e582-ded6-5248-a853-07e9784c509e",
    "payload": "Hello, how are you?",
    "media": [
        { "filename": "base64_of_file" }
    ]
}
```

### Explanation

- **type**: Defines the message type as "friendship".
- **channel**: Friendship ID (UUID) to identify the conversation.
- **payload**: The actual message content (e.g., text).
- **media**: Optional array of base64-encoded files (e.g., images or documents).
